/**
 *  The {@code TransitiveClosure} class represents a data type for 
 *  computing the transitive closure of a digraph.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation runs depth-first search from each vertex.
 *  The constructor takes time proportional to <em>V</em>(<em>V</em> + <em>E</em>)
 *  (in the worst case) and uses space proportional to <em>V</em><sup>2</sup>,
 *  where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>E</em> is the number of edges.
 *  <p>
 *  For large digraphs, you may want to consider a more sophisticated algorithm.
 *  <a href = "http://www.cs.hut.fi/~enu/thesis.html">Nuutila</a> proposes two
 *  algorithm for the problem (based on strong components and an interval representation)
 *  that runs in <em>E</em> + <em>V</em> time on typical digraphs.
 *
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph">Section 4.2</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
